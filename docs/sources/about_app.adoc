== This blog

This is my public knowledge base where I document technical solutions, code snippets, and resources I find useful. 
Think of it as my digital notebook rather than polished articles—a collection of practical notes about Python development, automation workflows, and software tooling.

Most posts revolve around KB4IT, a static site generator I am developing and use to build this very site. And MiAZ, my other pet project for organizing documents.

== Me

I love to develop for fun with a focus on free software and the GNOME ecosystem. 
I enjoy developing with GTK4, Libadwaita, and PyGObject for desktop application development.
