== Introduction

Finally, the index page for the blog theme, is working.
Posts' headers look nice.

However, at this point, the whole code is... spaguetti code.
`KB4IT` needs a big overhaul.

== Notes

Builder module works fine when the source files (.adoc files) are analyzed first. 
But other pages, like the index page, which are build at the end, do not follow the standard process.
