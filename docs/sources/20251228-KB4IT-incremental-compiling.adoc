== Introduction

These days, after several fixes, I was able to produce a reliable incremental compiling of my knowledge base repositories (or force a whole compilation of the whole KB, if the app meets some conditions).

To my initial surprise, it didn't work in Github.

== Github actions

In Github, when a new update is detected in the source directory, the Github action in charge (https://github.com/t00m/blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-blog.yml[update-blog.yml]) of updating the website is executed. 

GitHub Actions runners are ephemeral. Every workflow run starts on a fresh VM, so anything written to disk is lost unless you explicitly persist it somewhere.

== Solution

To be continued...
